Hi, there are two options for you to ask for help:

1. Post your issues on StackOverflow: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dji-sdk>, the community can help you.

2. Report your issues to <dev@dji.com>, as it's our official channel for developers to request DJI Developer Support now.

For DJI Developer Support, we have the following three tiers:

 - Standard 

  This free support is available to anyone reaching out to <dev@dji.com>. There is no guarantee for response time.
  
- Preferred
  
  This support comes with Pro membership for 99 USD per year. You can purchase it on [DJI Developer Website](https://developer.dji.com/user/membership/). These requests have priority over Standard ones. Starting today, Preferred questions will be replied to within 2 to 5 business days (Monday – Friday).
 
- Premium

  This one-time ticket is considered high-priority and costs 499 USD per issue. You can purchase it on [DJI Developer Website](https://developer.dji.com/user/support/) after you become the Pro membership developer. Starting today, Premium questions will be replied to within 1 business day (Monday – Friday). This may include communication with DJI SDK engineers, but will not involve face-to-face interaction. Time limitations apply, and please keep in mind that one question is permitted per ticket. We will do our best to resolve your issue, but there some situations demand deeper engineering efforts.
